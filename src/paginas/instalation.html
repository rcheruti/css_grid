    <p>
      At the moment your only option is to download the GitHub repo and get the
      code inside the <strong>dist</strong> folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want a final version of the code only, you can use one of the CSS
      files available on the <strong>dist</strong> folder. One is the compressed
      version, and the other an uncompressed version.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to change some of the screens sizes you will need to use the LESS
      version on the <strong>dist</strong> folder (the truth is that it 
      is the source file itself). <br/>
      In this case you will need a LESS compiler and a Autoprefixer to generate a
      CSS file with prefix for older browsers. <br/>
      You can take a look on the <strong>Gruntfile</strong> that is used to compile 
      this project to see how these can be configured. <br/>
      <br/>
      With grunt is used: <br/>
      <strong>grunt-contrib-less:</strong> to compile LESS code. <br/>
      <strong>grunt-postcss:</strong> as a Post compile CSS engine. Alone this do nothing. <br/>
      <strong>autoprefixer:</strong> as the prefixer for CSS, as a plugin to "postcss" <br/>
      <br/>
      All these can be found on <strong>package.json</strong> file and downloaded 
      from <strong>npm</strong>.
