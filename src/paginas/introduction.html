      This is <strong>Just Another Grid System</strong>, a CSS framework that will
      simplify the way you deal with multiple screen sizes, fluid layout,
      grids and columns on your sites and/or your applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      This framework have a goal to be small and to not have any "design" thing
      in it. <br>
      This code will help you layout your pages, but for designs for buttons, inputs,
      forms, cards and that things you will need another kind of code for that stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      This framework uses floats to get to the goal, and have a 12 column 
      grid system. You can configure a row to have a floating to the left
      or to the right depending on the screen size of the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      The code have a 6 screens sizes variables that you can use to configure
      the layout of the page. <br/>
      With these screen sizes you can configure the number of columns a row have,
      when a set of elements is visible on screen, what float left or right is used 
      on wich screen.
